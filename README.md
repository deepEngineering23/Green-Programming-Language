Using LexerTk for Lexer building

Applications of LexerTk:

Compiler Front-ends: LexerTk can serve as the front-end of compilers, converting source code into a stream of tokens for subsequent parsing and analysis.

Language Processing Tools: LexerTk can be used in various language processing tools, such as syntax checkers, code analyzers, and code generators.

Data Parsing and Validation: LexerTk can be employed for parsing and validating structured data formats, such as XML, JSON, or configuration files.

Domain-Specific Language Implementations: LexerTk can be utilized for implementing domain-specific languages (DSLs) by providing a foundation for lexical analysis.

# Rules of Language that can be parsed correctly

Functions are allowed , any expression is allowed , anything else not allowed (classes etc)

# How to run the parser
step 1) make
step 2) ./lexer ./path/of/file.gr (extension not specified yet in code)

# A binary lexer is alredy present in repo
